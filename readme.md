## Tasks
This branch contains some sample solutions and advice for reviewing your work.

Don't look at these until after you've opened your PR. We could hide these from you, but it's important that you understand that the goal is not to complete the assignment, the goal is to _learn_. 

When trainees plagiarise, copy, or rely on autocompletion to "complete" the coursework, they usually fail. By fail we mean fail to get a job. Unfortunately, you can't take your answers, autocompleter, or best mate into your job interview or live tech test with you. You need to learn this for real, because this is a really tough job market and it's _not good enough_ to copy-paste. 

Nobody is going to pay you to copy paste chunks of code you don't understand any more. CYF is not an accredited institution. This means you can't use our certificate to get a job without actually learning coding.

We do regard copying answers as cheating, but it's more important to understand this: The only person you can cheat here is yourself, as _you_ will be the one without a job while all your classmates (especially the ones that gave you the answers) are starting their exciting new careers. Don't let this be you.
