        <h1>The Importance of GIT</h1>
        <p class="pHeader">In the world of software development, where the creation and maintenance of code
          are at the heart of the process, the importance of version control cannot be overstated. GIT, a 
          distributed version control system, has emerged as a linchpin in modern software development 
          workflows. Its significance extends well beyond mere code management, impacting collaboration, 
          project organization, and code quality. In this Website, we'll bring you 3 definitions about GIT
          and why is an indispensable tool for developers and teams worldwide.

            <h2>What is GIT?</h2> 
            <p>
              GIT is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. 
              For example, when you edit a file, GIT can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, 
              and why. ... GIT isn't the only version control system out there, but it's by far the most popular.

              <p>
                They provide a platform to store and manage code, share projects with other people, collaborate on 
                coding projects and much more. Repositories also allow developers to keep track of the changes they 
                have made in their code over time. For more inf press READ MORE button.

              <h3>What is a branch in GIT?</h3>
              <p>
                A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the 
                edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
                staging area, and project history. For more inf press READ MORE button.
