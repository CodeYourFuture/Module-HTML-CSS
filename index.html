          <h2>What is GIT?</h2> 
          <p>
            Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. 
            For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, 
            and why. ... Git isn't the only version control system out there, but it's by far the most popular.

            <h3>Why do developers need GIT?</h3>
            <p>
              They provide a platform to store and manage code, share projects with other people, collaborate on 
              coding projects and much more. Repositories also allow developers to keep track of the changes they 
              have made in their code over time so they can quickly go back if needed.

            <h3>What is a branch in GIT?</h3>
            <p>
              A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the 
              edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
              staging area, and project history. For more information please press EEAD MORE.
