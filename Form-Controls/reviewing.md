## Extension Task

The minified sample solution has zero unused bytes. With Prettier installed the sample solution has 16 unused bytes, which are terminal semi colons. If anyone gets hung up on why they can't get to zero, that's why. The sample targets the questions and topics raised in class by NW4. There is a commented version that may be helpful when giving feedback.

When some trainees have completed this project, we can add common mistakes and feedback areas to this guide.
