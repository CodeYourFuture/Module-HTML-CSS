                <h1>Welcome in HF Cake Store.</h1>

        <p>
            We have something for every special occasion, from birthday cakes for everyone, cakes for special occasions throughout the year, be it Valentine, Eid, Christmas, or Easter. We have something for every party, big or small. You will find cakes in different shapes (round, square, heart, number), sizes from small celebration cakes to gigantic feast-worthy cakes. One thing is guaranteed with HF cake is quality. All of our cakes are freshly handmade in your local store. We only use our special egg-free recipe and fresh cream. When it comes to adding a personal touch to your celebration cake, we've got it covered. Most of our cakes come with a hand-piped personal message or even a photograph. Most of our customers prefer to collect the cake in one of our 10+ stores nationwide. But if you are looking for delivery, then we have got this covered too. Our cakes come in a variety of flavours and designs. You may be looking for a deluxe chocolate cake, or even a coconut, caramel or cookie cake. We have over 200 for you to choose from. If you have a special celebration you can rely on a HF Cake for a magical centrepiece and a wonderfully delicious slice for everyone.
