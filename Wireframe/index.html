          <h1>GIT</h1>
          <p>The acronym "Git" stands for <strong>"Global Information Tracker"</strong>. It was originally created by
            Linus
            Torvalds in
            2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, but over time, it has become a widely used version
            control
            system
            for managing code in various software projects.

        <h3>What is Git?</h3>
        <p class="about-git"><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system, which means that a local
          clone of the project
          is
          a complete
          version control
          repository. These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely. Developers
          commit their
          work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs
          from
          centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of
          code.
        </p>
        <p class="about-git">
          It is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a
          record of
          what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes
          collaboration
          easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

      <h3>Why do developers need Git?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          <strong>Developers</strong> rely on Git for version control, collaboration, and efficient code management. It
          enables parallel
          development through branching and merging, supports code review, offers backup and recovery options,
          encourages
          experimentation, and ensures isolated work. Git is vital for open source contributions, maintains a detailed
          history,
          and seamlessly integrates with development pipelines. Overall, Git enhances teamwork, accountability, and the
          overall
          development process.

        <h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>A Git branch</strong> is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows you to work
          on
          specific tasks or
          changes
          without affecting the main codebase. Each branch has its own set of commits, keeping changes isolated and
          enabling
          parallel development. Branches facilitate collaboration, experimentation, and versioning. They're useful
          for
          features,
          bug fixes, testing, and keeping different versions of the project. You can easily switch between branches
          to
          work on
          different aspects of the project.
