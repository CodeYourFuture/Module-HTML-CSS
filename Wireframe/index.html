              <p>
                Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects,
                and manage source code history. It provides a structured way to create snapshots of code, record modifications, 
                and manage different branches of development. Git enables team members to work concurrently on different features, 
                merge changes, and revert to previous versions,facilitating efficient and organized software development processes.

                Why do developers need Git?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Developers need Git because it offers a structured and collaborative way to manage source code, enabling version control,
                team collaboration, and code history tracking. It allows developers to work simultaneously on different features,
                roll back to previous states if needed, merge changes seamlessly, and maintain a clear record of code modifications. 
                This fosters efficient teamwork, reduces conflicts, and ensures the stability,
                traceability, and reliability of software projects throughout their lifecycle.

                What is a branch in Git?
              </h3>
              <p>
                In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that diverges from the main codebase (often called the "master" or "main" branch). 
                It allows developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without directly affecting the main code. 
                Each branch represents a specific set of commits and changes. Developers can create, switch between, and merge branches, 
                enabling concurrent work, isolation of changes, and the ability to collaborate on different aspects of a project simultaneously.
