        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to
          track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage
          project history efficiently. It allows for branching, merging, and
          version control, making it an essential tool for software development
          and code management. Git is widely used in open-source and
          collaborative software projects, providing a structured way to work on
          and maintain code bases.

        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git allows users to 'stage' and 'commit' files, enabling them to
          choose specific pieces for version tracking and updates. Online hosts
          such as GitHub and Bitbucket can be used for storing a copy of the Git
          repository, enabling smoother collaboration with other developers..

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>
          A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve
          as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of
          them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area,
          and project history.
