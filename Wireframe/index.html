      <h2>What is Git?</h2>
      <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any
        set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among
        programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during
        software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and
        support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel
        branches running on different computers).

          <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
          <p>
            Git is an immensely popular Version Control System, which allows
            developers to create a history of changes that occur over time in
            their code.

          <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>
            A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches
            serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can
            think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
            staging area, and project history.
