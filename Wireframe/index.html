        Git is a powerful tool that makes coding safer, more organized, and
        better for collaboration, whether you're working on a small personal
        project or a large software development team.

          <h2>What is git?</h2>
          <p>
            Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
            designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
            speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and
            has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then. It is used for:
            <li>Tracking code changes</li>
            <li>Tracking who made changes</li>
            <li>Coding collaboration</li>

            <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
            <p>
              Developers need Git because it provides a structured and efficient
              way to manage code, collaborate with others, maintain code
              quality, and streamline the development process. It is a
              fundamental tool for modern software development, whether working
              on personal projects, within a team, or contributing to
              open-source communities.

            <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>
              A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches
              serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can
              think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
              staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the
              history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the
              history of the project.
