        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p class="git-text">
          Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files
          and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is an
          essential tool in software development workflows helps developers
          manage and collaborate on software projects efficiently by tracking
          changes, enabling branching and merging, and providing a detailed
          history of project development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in
          2005 and has since become one of the most widely used tools in the
          software development industry. Git is designed to help developers
          collaborate on projects, manage different versions of their code, and
          track the history of changes made to a codebase.

        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p>
           Git is an essential tool for developers because it provides version
            control, facilitates collaboration, helps manage code history,
            enables safe experimentation, and supports various development
            workflows. It has become a fundamental part of modern software
            development practices, helping teams and individuals work more
            efficiently and effectively. With remote repositories, files are
            stored safely such that work-in-progress are not lost due to loss of
            or damage to local machines. Developers can collaborate easily with
            cloning, branching & merging and pull requests. These and others are
            why developers need to master and use Git.

        <h2>What is a branching in a Git?</h2>
        <p>Branching in Git is a powerful feature that allows developers to create separate lines of
            development within a Git repository. Each branch represents a distinct path of code changes.
            Branching enables developers to work on different features, bug fixes,
            or experiments simultaneously, without interfering with the main codebase.
