        <h1>What is a branch in Git?</h1>
        <p>
          In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository. Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

          When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.
          
          You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
          
          Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!
