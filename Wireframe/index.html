          <p class="info">
            Git is defined as a version control system. This means that it is essentially a content tracker, primarily used to store
            code. The “version” part of the definition refers to the ability to maintain a history of changes that have been made as
            additional updates are made to a given code. Git offers a remote repository stored in a server and a local repository
            stored in the server of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full
            copy of the code is present in all the developers' computers.

          <p class="info">
            Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes
            in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of their work.
            It is essential for project management, collaboration, and code integrity.

          <p class="info">
            In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that allows developers to work
            on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches enable
            parallel development and easy integration of changes.
