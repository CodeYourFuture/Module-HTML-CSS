      <h3>What is Git?</h3>
      <p>Git is a version control system for tracking code changes in software development. It allows multiple
        collaborators to work on code simultaneously, manage versions, and merge changes. Git is essential for
        organizing and maintaining code, ensuring collaboration, and enabling easy debugging and rollback when
        necessary.</p>

        developers to work on features or fixes independently before merging changes.</p>
